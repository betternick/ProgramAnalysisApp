Use this file to commit information clearly documenting your check-ins' content. If you want to store more information/details besides what's required for the check-ins that's fine too. Make sure that your TA has had a chance to sign off on your check-in each week (before the deadline); typically you should discuss your material with them before finalizing it here.

# Project 2 - Check-In 1
## Brief description of your discussions within your team so far, and any current candidate ideas for your project. You should talk with your TA/Alex/Caroline as soon as possible about these ideas; due to the project start mid-week it's OK if you have not yet done this, but make sure to note the progress you have made so far.
Our team has been actively discussing potential project ideas, and currently, two concepts are under consideration. Idea 1 focuses on generating a comprehensive code coverage report through both dynamic and static analyses. Dynamic analysis assesses executed lines, while static analysis involves determining branches and paths. However, the initial feedback from the TA highlighted the need for a stronger analysis component and more robust visualization. Idea 2 involves creating a call graph through static analysis, mapping functions and their interactions, which received positive feedback from the TA for its solid static analysis and visualization components. The team has unanimously opted for Java as the programming language due to its familiarity among team members and the availability of resources within the classroom.

## Any planned follow-up tasks for the next week.
Moving forward, our team aims to refine the chosen ideas based on the TA's feedback. We acknowledge the importance of strengthening the analysis components and enhancing the visualization aspect to meet project goals effectively. As we continue brainstorming, we are open to exploring additional program analysis ideas that align with our objectives. Our goal for the upcoming week is to finalize the project ideas, seek TA approval, and subsequently allocate tasks for implementation, ensuring a well-structured and collaborative development process.
